Each profile stores a detailed history of quiz sessions, including categories, difficulty levels, scores, test dates, and the highest number of questions answered correctly.


### Category Selection:

Users can choose the category they want to be tested in, such as Artificial Intelligence, Security, or Programming.


### Difficulty Filtering:

Users can filter questions by difficulty level (e.g., Easy, Medium, Hard) or select a random mix for a varied challenge.


### Customizable Quiz Length:

Users can specify the number of questions they want to answer, and the application randomly selects a subset based on the chosen category and difficulty.


### Immediate Feedback:

After each question, users receive instant feedback on whether their answer was correct. If incorrect, the correct answer is displayed for learning purposes.


### Final Score Summary:

At the end of the quiz, users are presented with their total score and a summary of their performance.


### Progress Tracking:

Quiz performance, including category, difficulty level, score, and timestamp, is recorded in the user profile to track progress over time.


## Optional/Advanced Features

### Timed Questions:
Users are given a time limit to answer each question, adding an element of challenge to the quiz.

### Quiz History Export:
Users can export their quiz history, including details like category, difficulty level, scores, and timestamps, to a text file for record-keeping.

### Random Category Selection:
Users can select a "Random" category that combines questions from all available categories and difficulty levels for a diverse quiz experience.
